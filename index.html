	<h2>La Comtessed'Escarbagna</h2>
	This play by Molière,  La Comtesse d'Escarbagnas, is one of his least
known works.  It wasn't published during Molière life time, and after
reading it you will understand why. It certainly doesn't  measure up to
the other works that are still being presnted today.

This play was chosen for this project as a means of demonstrating
that the creating of interlinear text and syncing it with audio can be
done using readily available open source tools.

The play met serval criteria:
							<ul>
							<li>All the elements had to either be in the public domain or relased under the proper use licenses</li>
							<li>An audio recording of decent quality needed to be available</li>
							<li>The text needed to be in a useable format</li>
							<li>The text and audio had to agree in order for the alignment and syncing to work</li>
							<li>And it should be a good length, between 25 to 35 minutes</li>
							<li>A bonus was that it is by Molière which has great name recogination.</li> 
 							</ul>

		<p>The play is viewerable on YouTube. Please feel free to comment. I personally will proabley never do another play as to the difficulty of getting the format of the scrolling text to fit the scene. </p>

		<h2>Translation</h2>

		The play was machine translated using the Google Chrome browser. Yup, not nearly as good as a more intelligent human translation would have been, but it is fast. 
		I realized that this was major trade off and the where I get the most negatives. <img-thumbs down></img-thumbs>.  So for all the maoners and groaners I have the solution; crowd source a better solution.
		below is a lsit of the scenes and a lik to a Google Spread sheet. When you see a tranlation that yo know that can be improve go to the spreadsheet; find the word or phase and enter it into column C; a comment can be left expalining your reasons and/or the reason.  When you make the edit and/or comment the page editor will be notified.
