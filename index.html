	<h2>La Comtesse d'Escarbagna</h2>
<p>			
	This play by Molière,  La Comtesse d'Escarbagnas, is one of his
least
known works.  It wasn't published during Molière life time and after
reading it you will understand why. It certainly doesn't measure up
to
the other works that are still being presented today.
</p>
						

<p>
This play was chosen for this project as a means of demonstrating
that the creating of interlinear text and syncing it with audio can
be done using readily available open source tools.
</p>

<p>
The play met serval criteria:
							<ul>
							<li>All the elements had to either be in
the public domain or relased under the proper use licenses.</li>
							<li>An audio recording of decent
quality.</li>
							<li>The text needed to be in a useable
format.</li>
							<li>The text and audio had to agree in
order for the syncing to work.</li>
							<li>And it should be a good length,
between 25 to 35 minutes.</li>
							<li>A bonus is that it is by Molière
who	 has great name recogination.</li> 
 							</ul>

And of course the playwright desrves some attention. 
Wikipedia does a much better job of telling about his life then I
could ever do. So click his picture.

		<h2>YouTube Movie</h2>
		<p>The play is on YouTube. Please feel free to comment either
there or the email provided below. I will never do another play as to
the difficulty of getting the scrolling text to fit the scene.
YouTube is the main distribution channel as the file size of a 30 minute program
is too large to be handled without paying for the bandwidth. </p>

		<h2>Translation</h2>
		<p>

		The play is machine translated using the Google Chrome
browser. Yup, not nearly as good as a human translation
would have been, but it is fast. 
		</p>
		<p>
			This is a major trade off and the where I get the most
negatives reactions.  So for all groaners I have the solution; which
is to crowd souce a better translation.
		</p>
		<p>
			Here is a list of the scenes which link to a Google Spread
sheet. When you see a tranlation that can be improve, go to the
spreadsheet; find the word or phase and enter it into column C. You
can leave a comment explaining your  the reason.  When you make an
edit and/or comment the page editor will be notified.

		<h2>End Note</h2>
		<p>
	This site is the first part of providing evidence that an
interlinear site can be built with open source or free resources.
Right now this is a one person shop, but it's hoped that others will
see the value in this approach and step in.  The one person running this 
shop is only interested in French as a target language and someone else needs to do 
other language pairs. 
		</p>
<p>
		The best combination of language pairs will most likely have English as a target language.
Someone should step up and take charge. That the major reason this work is 
being done is to show that it can be done. Hopefully this will  start a community to support 
the work of JHS.
</p>
<p>
One of the most important task is to produce work that people want to read.
	Dr. Stephan Krashen<a href="http://www.sdkrashen.com/"><sup>1</sup></a> idea of 'Free Voluntary Reading' as a means of acquiring a second language.
<link to SK page as a superscript>.
</p>
<p>
	Rather then make a choice on what I liked I looked at what works survived the 
filter of time and remain popular today. From the 19th century, not  much.
One of my favorites, who is still popular, is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexandre_Dumas,_fils">Alexander Dumas</a>, <link wikipedia>wrote novels 
that have never gone out of print and 
which has been made into movies, plays, comic books and a video game.But
the works are too long to be a demonstration project.

<p>
Just a few general observations about how to benefit the most from our work.
</p>
				<h3><ul>
					<li>If you aren't enjoying it. Go do something else with the remaining
					 few seconds of your precious life.</li>
					 <li>Time to spend in one session. As long as you want, but be aware that
					 healthy adults appears to have a sustained attention span about 20-30 minutes
					 <a href="https://www.scribd.com/document/265348695/Microsoft-Attention-Spans-Research-Report"><sup>2</sup></a>Break up a session into manageable chunks.</li>
					 <li>A means of  structuring you time is the Pomorodo method. <a href="https://cirillocompany.de/pages/pomodoro-technique">pomodoro</a></li>
					 <li>It's been reported that some people undergo a 'code shift' after using this 
					 this mehtod. I can't find  reference to this, but it has happened to me at about 30 minutes.</li>
					<li>Barbara Oakly <a href="https://barbaraoakley.com/"><sup>3</sup></a>recommends the use of over the ear headphones to 
					 help in reducing distractions while focusing.</li>
					 <li>See item at top of list to check that you aren't wasting your time.</li>
